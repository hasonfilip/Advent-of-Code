# Advent of Code 

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) challenges. The challenges are released daily in December leading up to Christmas.

## [2021](2021)
I was doing the 2021 AoC puzzles retrospectively during fall 2024 when I felt like coding something different. I picked the GAWK I was tinkering with at that time.

## [2022](2022)
I was solving the 2022 puzzles during summer 2024. I was preparing for my first job, so I used PHP for practise.

## [2023](2023)
2023 was the first year I tried the advent of code challenge as it was coming up. I chose Python for that as it was my best language at that time. I've decided to upload only few days as most solutions weren't worth sharing.

## [2024](2024)
My second year of solving advent of code. I decided to go with GAWK, which was my favourite scripting language back then and which is especially handy for parsing the input files.

## [2025](2025)
For the year 2025, only 12 days of puzzles are released. I've opted for Perl this time around as I was looking for an opportunity to learn it.
